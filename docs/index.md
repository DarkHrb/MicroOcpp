ArduinoOcpp is an OCPP client which runs on microcontrollers and enables EVSEs to participate in OCPP charging networks. As a software library, it can be added to the firmware of the EVSE and will become a new part of it. If the EVSE has already an internet controller, then most likely, no extra hardware is required.

<!-- This chapter shows how to kick-start your OCPP project. -->
